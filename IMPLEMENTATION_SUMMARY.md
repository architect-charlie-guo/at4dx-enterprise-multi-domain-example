# AT4DX Enterprise Multi-Domain Example - Implementation Summary

This project demonstrates a sophisticated AT4DX-based enterprise application with multiple 2nd-generation packages. Here's what has been implemented:

## 2nd Generation Packages

### AT4DX-SharedServices
- Custom objects for cross-cutting concerns (IntegrationLog__c, ErrorLog__c, BatchProcessControl__c)
- Enterprise event platform (EnterpriseEvent__e)
- Base services for logging and event publishing
- Trigger framework for handling platform events

### AT4DX-AccountManagement
- Accounts domain class with business logic
- Account selector with query methods
- Account service for business operations
- Trigger for domain process injection
- Dependency injection configuration via custom metadata

### AT4DX-ProductManagement
- Products domain class with business logic
- Product selector with query methods
- Product service for business operations
- Trigger for domain process injection
- Dependency injection configuration via custom metadata

### AT4DX-Marketing
- Domain process injection into the Account domain:
  - HighValueAccountCriteria to identify high-value accounts
  - AssignMarketingSegmentAction to assign marketing segments
- Selector field injection to add marketing fields to account queries
- Custom metadata configuration for both extension points

### AT4DX-Sales
- Event consumers for Account and Product events
- Cross-package integration via platform events
- Subscription configuration via custom metadata

## Non-Packaged Components

### Happy Soup
- Components spanning multiple domains
- Standard object customizations with circular dependencies
- Cross-domain processes
- Final permission assignments

## DevOps Artifacts

- Deployment script with dependency management
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD including:
  - Automated package version creation
  - Change-based deployment logic
  - Test automation
- Scratch org definition
- Package structure with proper dependencies

## Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

1. **Domain Process Injection** - Marketing package extends Account behavior
2. **Platform Event Distribution** - Sales package listens to events from other packages
3. **Selector Field Injection** - Marketing package adds fields to Account queries
4. **Application Factory Injection** - Consistent dependency injection across packages

## Package Versioning

The project is now set up for proper 2nd-generation package development:

- Each package has a defined version number (1.0.0.NEXT)
- Dependencies between packages are explicitly defined
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates package versions
- Deployment scripts handle package dependencies

## Next Steps

To further expand this implementation, you could:

1. Complete test classes for each package
2. Add UI components aligned with package boundaries
3. Implement more cross-package integration scenarios
4. Set up permission sets for each package
5. Create installation scripts for orgs
6. Add documentation for each package's public interfaces

This implementation demonstrates the core patterns of AT4DX and provides a solid foundation for building scalable, modular enterprise applications on Salesforce.
