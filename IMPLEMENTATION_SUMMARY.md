# AT4DX Enterprise Example - Implementation Summary

This project demonstrates a sophisticated AT4DX-based enterprise application with multiple packages. Here's what has been implemented so far:

## Foundation Packages

### Shared Services Package
- Custom objects for cross-cutting concerns (IntegrationLog__c, ErrorLog__c, BatchProcessControl__c)
- Enterprise event platform (EnterpriseEvent__e)
- Base services for logging and event publishing
- Trigger framework for handling platform events

### Account Management Package
- Accounts domain class with business logic
- Account selector with query methods
- Account service for business operations
- Trigger for domain process injection
- Dependency injection configuration via custom metadata

### Product Management Package
- Products domain class with business logic
- Product selector with query methods
- Product service for business operations
- Trigger for domain process injection
- Dependency injection configuration via custom metadata

## Extension Packages

### Marketing Package (extending Account Management)
- Domain process injection into the Account domain:
  - HighValueAccountCriteria to identify high-value accounts
  - AssignMarketingSegmentAction to assign marketing segments
- Selector field injection to add marketing fields to account queries
- Custom metadata configuration for both extension points

### Sales Package (extending both Account and Product Management)
- Event consumers for Account and Product events
- Cross-package integration via platform events
- Subscription configuration via custom metadata

## DevOps Artifacts

- Deployment script with dependency management
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Scratch org definition
- Package structure with proper dependencies

## Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

1. **Domain Process Injection** - Marketing package extends Account behavior
2. **Platform Event Distribution** - Sales package listens to events from other packages
3. **Selector Field Injection** - Marketing package adds fields to Account queries
4. **Application Factory Injection** - Consistent dependency injection across packages

## Next Steps

To complete this implementation, you would:

1. Implement the remaining packages (Service, Operations, Finance, Legal)
2. Add tests for each package
3. Create data migration scripts
4. Implement UI components
5. Set up permissions and security

This sample implementation focuses on the core AT4DX patterns and package structure, showcasing how to build a modular, loosely-coupled architecture that supports independent package development and deployment.
